# Incident-Response-Play-Book-for-Cloud-Storage-Misconfiguration

## Purpose
* This playbook covers the handling of cloud misconfiguration which is a potential security issue with the migration of data of corporate entities with the advancement of technology.

## Scope
* This playbook applies in the following scenarios,
  - in the event of a data breach
  - unauthorized access due to misconfiguration
  - privilege escalation from overly broad IAM roles

## Detection and Analysis
* Exposure of sensitive data to unathorized parties
* Privilege escalation of external IAM roles
* Leakage of credentials
* Unintended public access to storage buckets, APIs, or databases
* Large data transfers
* Monitoring tools (CloudTrail - records user activity and API usage)

## Containment
* Immediately restrict public access to misconfigured resources (making storage buckets private)
* Isolation of affected systems to prevent lateral movement
* Block overly permissive IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles
* Verify logs

## Eradication
* Enabling Principle of Least Priviledge (POLP)
  - Managing the permission to users and giving minimum permission for the fulfillment of their tasks
* Multli-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  - Enabling MFA to all users creates and extra layer of security
* Continuous audits
  - Regular reviewing the configuration to ensure that it aligns with security best practices and policies
* Automated security checkups
  - Utilize automated tools to scan cloud environment against predefined security policies
* Regular security vulnerability assessments
  - To enable necessary security patches
* Data encryption
* Security training
  - Providing security training to cloud users and administrators to raise awareness

## Recovery
* Restoration from backups (if available)
* Identify security vulnerabilities and take necessary actions to patch them.
* Assess the impact
* Review audit logs
* Implement Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools to identify misconfigurations and assess the cloud environment

## Lessons learned
* Importance of cloud security
* Requirement of robust security patches
* Importance of continuous monitoring
* Updating documentation regarding cloud configurations
